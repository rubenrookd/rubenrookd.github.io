<h1 class="title">A New Dream</h1>
<p>
This is my very first post!
</p>

<p>
For the past couple years I have been going over in my head what I should dedicate myself to.
</p>

<p>
I switched jobs from being an insurance agent during a critical time in the industry. I couldn't stomach the insane price points everything was going to, and I had always wanted to do something in media production, so I jumped ship.
</p>

<p>
And then I was unemployed for over a year, trying to get a job in something that I was passionate about (ideally in media production). This proved to be impossible, as the job market was (and is) on a downward spiral in favor of automation via Large Langauge Models. So settled down with a job with family.
</p>

<p>
This job wasn't bad, it was great even. Yet still this quesiton about what I should dedicate my life to was still in my head.
</p>

<p>
So like many others who haven't got a clue what they should do, I went to these fancy language models to think through the problem with me.
</p>

<p>
It essentially told me this:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
"You are a Systems Director. Your "ideal purpose" is to identify where the "pipes" of society are clogged (Incentives/Coordination), use your technical mind to design a better "plumbing" system (Architecture), and use your expressive skills to convince the "able-minded people" to help you install it"
</p>
</blockquote>


<p>
Now, I'm not a fan of AI's psychofantic demeanor, (I'm no Systems Direcotor) but I quite liked what we came up.
</p>

<p>
So that's the plan. Moving forward I am going to be in the business of trying to inspire change and bulding a culture around hope and egalitarianism.
</p>

<p>
This means doing research in how things operate, the system in which people operate in, and how people think about it, and formulating strategies on what could be better world.
</p>

<p>
Now, such things are not easy, I have no delusion of that. At this point, I'm facing issues that organizations spend millions of dollars with stacked workforces to solve, alone.
</p>

<p>
But hey, I was already unemployed before, and this is my life's purpose we're talking about here. I might as well try.
</p>

<p>
Such is life, we just gotta try.
